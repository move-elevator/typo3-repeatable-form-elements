2. Make your changes and ensure all linters and tests pass.
3. Use descriptive commit messages following the conventional commits format: `<type>: <description>` (e.g. `feat: add nested repeatable container support`, `fix: resolve copy button state after removal`).

## Submit a pull request

After completing your work, **open a pull request** and provide a description of your changes. Ideally, your PR should reference an issue that explains the problem you are addressing.
